His stirring win over world champion Magnus Carlsen in the eighth round caused a flutter but up-and-down performances pegged Praggnanandhaa back. He finished 11th in the standings with 19 points with the top eight going through to the knockout phase. A 32-move win over Keymer saw the teenaged Indian GM finish the event on a high. He scored five wins from 15 rounds, drew four games and lost six. The victories included those over Carlsen, top-10 player Lev Aronian, Russian Andrey Esipenko, former women's world champion Alexandra Kosteniuk and Keymer. Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi topped the preliminary stage, racking up 29 points while Carlsen overcame a few defeats to finish second on 25 points, followed by Artemiev (24). Esipenko, Eric Hansen (Canada), Ding Liren and Liem Quang Le (both China) and Keymer rounded off the top eight. In the 16-player Airthings Masters, a player received three points for a win and one for a draw in the preliminary rounds. (PTI)",

The guidelines have been issued after consulting industry stakeholders, including the Union government. The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) noted that even as the government continues to work on the framework for virtual digital assets (VDA), commonly referred to as crypto or non-fungible token (NFT) products, advertising for these products has been very aggressive over the past few months. \"ASCI noted that several of these advertisements do not adequately disclose the risks associated with such products,\" it said in a release. As per the guidelines, all virtual digital asset-related ads released on or after April 1 must carry the disclaimer, \"Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky. There may be no regulatory recourse for any loss from such transactions.\" The disclaimer will have to be carried in promotional content in print, video and audio mediums. In print or static, the disclaimer must be equal to at least 1/5th of the advertising space at the bottom of the advertisement in an easy to read font, against a plain background, and to the maximum font size afforded by the space. In audio, the disclaimer must be spoken at the end of the advertisement and the voiceover should be at a normal speaking pace and must not be hurried. The guidelines also cover social media posts. The advertising body has also barred advertisers to use words \"currency\", \"securities\", \"custodian\" and \"depositories\" in advertisements of VDA products or services as \"consumers associate these terms with regulated products\". Also, advertisements that provide information on the cost or profitability of VDA products must contain clear, accurate, sufficient and updated information.",

    "full_description": "We bring you a story this week revealing how the capital behind the early settlement of North Vancouver came from a family fortune amassed through the transatlantic slave trade . It is both illuminating and maddening. In Canada, we have a nasty habit of dismissing racism and discussions of slavery as American issues, not our own. We now know just how wrong that is. There are most likely other Canadian communities and institutions that are a legacy of slavery too, if only we know where to look. And the abolition of slavery has been followed by decades of both legal and social persecution. Wealth begat wealth. Exclusion begat exclusion. That is nature of systemic racism. Here on the North Shore, we have seen legal covenants barring people of colour from owning homes, and the abuse directed at the family of athletes and activists Harry and Valerie Jerome when their parents came to North Vancouver in 1951. These are very much our problems. We foresee already some folks in the community will take issue with this story. It’s “divisive” to dredge up racial injustices, they say – as if keeping them hidden is somehow nobler. The sooner we acknowledge our real history, the sooner we can have a more productive discussion about how to properly redress those injustices. We have an equally bad habit of failing to properly celebrate the achievements of Black people in Canada. As this Black History Month draws to its close, we urge everyone to acknowledge both – the struggle and the success. Only then can we start building a history to be proud of.",

    "full_description": "The wait is almost over. Netflix just announced an official release date for Ozark Season 4 Part 2, and it’s much closer than most people realized. On top of that, Netflix released a short teaser trailer for the second half of the season. Here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming conclusion to the Byrde family’s criminal endeavors. [Warning: This article contains spoilers for Ozark Season 4 Part 1.] ‘Ozark’ Season 4 | Cr. Netflix ‘Ozark’ Season 4 Part 2 picks up right after the shocking end of part 1 When we last left the folks in Ozark Season 4, things were not looking good for Wendy (Laura Linney) and Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman). Their deal with the FBI went sour. Also, their FBI contact, Maya (Jessica Francis Dukes,) arrested Mexican cartel leader Omar Navarro (Felix Solis). His nephew, Javi (Alfonso Herrera,) believes the Byrdes were behind the arrest. Plus, when the CEO of the pharmaceutical company chose to buy Darlene Snell’s (Lisa Emery) heroin instead of the Navarro cartel’s heroine, Javi decided to get revenge by killing both Darlene and her new husband, Wyatt (Charlie Tahan). One of the last scenes showed Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) discovering Wyatt’s dead body. This sent Ruth into a hysterical rage. She didn’t care that the Mexican cartel was behind the murders, and she took off with baby Zeke and a shotgun in her lap. Netflix’s official synopsis for the conclusion of the series reads, ​​” Marty and Wendy are rid of Helen and climb to the top of Navarro’s empire. They find another opportunity to get out of the Ozarks but some past sins won’t stay buried and the most dangerous threats come from blood.” The end is near. Ozark's final episodes premiere April 29. pic.twitter.com/WWBPFmlXlY— Netflix (@netflix) February 23, 2022 RELATED: ‘Ozark’: Wyatt Actor Reacts to That Shocking Moment in Season 4 Episode 7 ‘Ozark’ Season 4 Part 2 arrives on April 29, 2022 The death of Ruth’s cousin, Wyatt, set up the final seven episodes in Ozark Season 4 Part 2. Ruth’s plan to go up against the cartel is essentially a death sentence. However, because Wyatt was one of the people she loved most in life, she doesn’t seem to care. The Byrdes were almost free from their dangerous life of money laundering and drug deals, and it couldn’t come at a better time. Jonah (Skyler Gaertner,) their son, recently started laundering money for Darlene, and Wendy was desperate to get him away. However, there’s still the issue of Jonah’s anger at his mother for ordering the murder of his beloved Uncle Ben. Netflix News: Part II of #Ozark's final season will drop on April 29. pic.twitter.com/CZhmpxyVqo— Brandon Katz (@Great_Katzby) February 23, 2022 Several questions still need answers in the final episodes Following the plot of Ozark might make audiences’ heads spin. Now that the show is in the home stretch, there are only a few questions left that need answers. During the opening scene of Ozark Season 4 Part 1, fans watched as the Byrdes appeared to leave their life of crime behind them. However, the van they’re driving in soon crashes, and folks wondered if anyone in the family survived the wreck. Was the car crash a dream? Were viewers watching some version of the future? The goat urn Ruth chose to store Ben’s ashes seemed to be an odd focal point in Ozark Season 4 Part 1. Will fans eventually understand the meaning behind the urn? Did Ben really die? The teaser trailer focuses on Ruth. This hints that fans will most likely learn the truth about Ben’s death and the meaning behind the urn. Only seven episodes remain, and several loose ends need to be tied up. Thankfully, April 29, 2022, is only a few weeks away. Stream previous episodes of Ozark exclusively on Netflix.

    "full_description": "Finally. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Following a brief appearance in January, Sony is officially bringing the ability to have your PS5 screenshots and videos auto-uploaded to the PlayStation mobile app to more countries. Sony began testing the feature in Canada and Japan in October. The expanded rollout, which Sony stresses is a gradual one, will start first with the Americas, the company says. On a support page, Sony lists the following as “supported countries”: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the US, and Uruguay. The feature will come to more countries “next month,” the company says in a tweet. If the feature is enabled, media captured from your PS5 will be automatically uploaded to the cloud so they appear on the app. (Sony says you’ll need the latest version of the PlayStation app on iOS or Android.) From the app, you can save captures to your phone, share them with your PlayStation friends, or post them to social media. You can watch this video from Sony to see how it works. We’re gradually rolling out the ability to share your PS5 game captures through PS App in more regions! Americas are first up, with more countries next month. Details: https://t.co/yskER3hn8t pic.twitter.com/8sfrm6PZZj— PlayStation (@PlayStation) February 23, 2022 The feature is currently live for me in the US. I took a screenshot in Horizon Forbidden West, and a few moments later, it popped up in the app. As far as I can tell, it all works like it did when it was briefly enabled for me in January. Previously, it was a much bigger hassle to take captures off your PS5, so I’m happy this feature is finally rolling out. We’re gradually rolling out the ability to share your PS5 game captures through PS App in more regions! Americas are first up, with more countries next month.

    "full_description": "ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Hawks are aiming for a top-six spot in the NBA playoffs, knowing a repeat of their pace before the All-Star break won’t be close to good enough. One year after advancing to the Eastern Conference finals, the Hawks feel a sense of urgency to improve their play in the final 24 games of the regular season. They visit Chicago on Thursday night to open a crucial stretch of four games against teams ahead of them in the conference playoff standings, including two against the Bulls. A rocky first half, packed with winning and losing streaks, has the Hawks (28-30) tied with Charlotte for ninth in the conference. Atlanta is perilously close to falling out of the play-in tournament. The Hawks won their last two games before the break, including a 130-109 runaway win at Orlando on March 16. The visit to the Bulls, tied for the top spot in the East, provides an opportunity to gain momentum for a playoff push. “We’ve got no more time to dig ourselves holes,” guard Kevin Huerter said after Wednesday’s practice. “I think we’ve done that a couple times this year where we’ve lost four or five games in a row and put ourselves in a pretty bad position. We don’t have time to do that. But if we can put together wins and put together a streak or two to end the season, we’re going to be right there in the mix where we need to be.” The Hawks lost five straight games in early January before recovering with a seven-game winning streak. Similarly, they followed a six-game skid in early November with seven consecutive wins. Atlanta’s schedule following the All-Star break is challenging. After hosting Toronto on Saturday, the Hawks visit Boston on Tuesday before facing the Bulls again on March 3. Before they can have a realistic shot at finishing above the cut for the play-in tournament, the Hawks must avoid falling below the No. 10 spot. “We’re just taking one game at a time,” said Hawks coach Nate McMillan. “We know we’re going to have to put a streak of games together with only 24 games left in the season. But again, talking about it, we’re pretty much past that. We know what we have to do.” The Hawks likely won’t have their full lineup when they renew their playoff push. Forward John Collins missed the last three games with a strained right foot. Collins was limited to shooting, with no running, on Tuesday and Wednesday. Collins, who didn’t appear to favor the foot as he launched jumpers on Wednesday, was expected to join the team for the flight to Chicago. As always, the Hawks will lean on Trae Young, coming off his second All-Star start. Young’s 27.8 points per game ranks fourth in the league. Chicago’s DeMar DeRozan is third at 28.1. While defending NBA champion Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Brooklyn have commanded the most national attention, the rise of such teams as Chicago, Miami and Cleveland add depth to the Eastern Conference. That increases the difficulty of Atlanta moving up in the playoff standings. “There’s pressure on every game from here on out,” Huerter said. “Obviously, we need wins. We’re not looking at the next four. We’re looking at the next one.” ___ More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Tuesday that Canada will deploy an additional 460 Canadian troops to help NATO in its standoff with Russia, including an artillery unit, a naval frigate and a surveillance aircraft.
